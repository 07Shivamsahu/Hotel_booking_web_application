JWT token is stored in local storage or cookies on the client side for subsequent authenticated requests.

2. Hotel Search:
User initiates a hotel search by providing search criteria (location, dates, etc.).
Frontend sends search parameters to the backend.
Backend queries the database for matching hotels based on the search criteria.
Backend returns a list of hotels to the frontend for display.

3. Booking Process:
User selects a hotel and room, enters booking details, and initiates the booking process.
Frontend sends booking details to the backend.
Backend validates the booking request and checks room availability.
If available, the backend creates a booking record in the database and initiates payment processing.
Upon successful payment, the backend confirms the booking and sends a confirmation email to the user.

4. Admin Operations:
Admin performs operations like adding/editing/deleting hotels, managing bookings, etc.
Admin interface interacts with backend services to perform these operations.
